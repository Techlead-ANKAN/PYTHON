New Delhi: The government has called for a "special session of Parliament" to be held from September 18 to 22, Union Minister Pralhad Joshi posted on X (formerly Twitter), adding, that there will be five sittings. "Amid Amrit Kaal, looking forward to having a fruitful discussion and debate in Parliament," he said. Government sources have, so far, been tight-lipped on possible agendas. There is speculation the special session is being called to begin the process of shifting from the old to the new Parliament building. So, this session may begin in the old and end in the new. Also, it may not be a joint session of the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha.
