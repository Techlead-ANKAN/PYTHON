root.geometry("1920x1080")
root.title("Ankan's GUI")   # sets the title of the GUI

# Attributes of Label: -  (* - common / important)

# *1) text -- Used to set the text as a label
# 2) anchor -- It is used to control the positioning of the text
# *3) bg -- It is used to set the background colour of the label
# 4) height -- It is used to set the vertical dimension of the frame
# 5) width -- It is used to set the width of the label in characters (not pixels). If this option is not set, the label will be sized to fit its contents.
# *6) bd -- It is used to set the size of the border.
# *7) font -- specifies the font
# 8) cursor -- It is used to specify what cursor to show when the it is hovered over the label. (Default - standard cursor)
# 9) textvariable -- As the name suggests it is associated with a Tkinter variable (usually a StringVar) with the label. If the variable is changed, the label text is updated.
# 10) bitmap -- It is used to set the bitmap to the graphical object specified so that, the label can represent the graphics instead of text.
# *11) fg -- The colour of the label(text)
# 12) image -- It is used to display the a static image in the label widget
# *13) padx -- padding in x-driection
# *14) pady -- padding in y-direction
# 15) justify -- it is used to define how to align multiple lines of text. Use LEFT, RIGHT and CENTER as its values.
# *16) relief -- It sets a specific border. SUNKEN, RAISED, GROOVE, RIDGE
# 17) underline -- you can display an underline below the nth character, counting form 0, by setting this option to n. the default is underline = -1, which means no underlining.
# 18) wraplength -- Instead of having only one line as the label text it can be broken into to the number of lines where each line has the number of characters specified to this option.

# Syntax: - Label(options....)
lb = Label(text = "Ankan is a good boy.", bg = "white", fg = "black", padx = 100, pady = 100, font = "arial 20 bold", borderwidth = 5, relief = RIDGE)

# Attributes of Pack: -

# 1) side -- It is used to set the GUI in which sides - BOTTOM, TOP, LEFT, RIGHT. Default --> TOP
# 2) anchor -- It is used to set the GUI in the spcified position in the side.
# 4) fill -- It is used to expand the label in 2 directions - X and Y. Fill in x-direction is possible only when side = TOP / BOTTOM. Fill in y-direction is possible only when side = LEFT / RIGHT
# 5) padx -- padding in x-driection
# 6) pady -- padding in y-driection

# Syntax: - pack(options....)
lb.pack(side = TOP, anchor = "n", padx = 50, pady =50)
